<p>
Quick IP settings is a small application making it effortless to quickly manage IP settings for several network interfaces. The network interfaces are scanned and listed automatically.
</p>
<p>
The application allows switching between static and dynamic IP (DHCP) and changing the subnet mask and default gateway.
</p>
<p>
Administrative rights are required to run the application so that the changes in the IP settings take effect.

A very helpful part of the code (VisualTreeHelpers) was originally created by Rachel Lim and was found <a href="https://rachel53461.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/navigating-wpfs-visual-tree/">here</a>.
